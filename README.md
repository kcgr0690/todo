What your project is/does (and what it's called):
My project is a simple To-Do list project- users are able to enter a task, select a priority for it, add a due date, edit the task, and delete the task. It's Simply called To-Do. :)

Why you made your project:
I made my project because I'm in need of a convenient to-do list that sorts by priority, and is customizable. It was a lot of fun to make, though I spent hours struggling with bugs haha

How you made your project:
I made this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Since I'm new to all 3 languages (submitting this for the level up challenge), I used google as well. It was quite difficult to code and I spent more time learning than coding, but it was a cool experience.

What you struggled with and what you learned:
As previously mentioned, I struggled a TON with bugs that I couldn't figure out, and spent a good amount of tiem scrolling through my MASSIVE JavaScript file rying to track down and eliminate the bugs. I learned HTML, JS, and CSS, and I really enjoyed specifically the CSS. (It was a lot more forgiving and less error-causing than JavaScript)

Overall, this project was a lot of fun, but the astronomical amount of bugs was a real headache :')
